I'll implement:

 DFS with adjacency list (recursive)
 -DFS with adjacency list (iterative with stack)
 DFS with adjacency matrix (recursive)
 -DFS with adjacency matrix (iterative with stack)
 -BFS with adjacency list
 -BFS with adjacency matrix
 single-source shortest path (Dijkstra)
 minimum spanning tree(prim and kruskal algorithm)
DFS-based algorithms (see Aduni videos above):
 -check for cycle (needed for topological sort, since we'll check for cycle before starting)
 -topological sort
 -count connected components in a graph
 list strongly connected components
 check for bipartite graph
